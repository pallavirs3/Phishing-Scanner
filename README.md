Phishing Link Scanner

This Python program helps identify potentially malicious phishing links. Phishing attacks try to trick users into clicking on links that appear legitimate but can steal personal information or infect devices.

How it Works:

Checks URL characteristics:

Looks for IP addresses directly in the URL. Flags URLs that are unusually long (more than 75 characters). Searches for suspicious keywords in the URL, such as "login," "verify," "update," or "banking."

Fetches and analyzes content (if URL passes initial checks):

Downloads the webpage content associated with the URL. Parses the content using BeautifulSoup. Checks forms for suspicious elements like password fields or actions related to login or verification. Looks for a high frequency of keywords like "login," "account," or "verify" within the page content.

Provides Risk Assessment:

If the URL exhibits suspicious characteristics or the content raises red flags, the program raises a warning message. If no warnings are triggered, the program indicates that the URL seems safe (but further manual verification may be recommended).

How to Use:

Save the script as a Python file (e.g., phishing_scanner.py). Upload the file to your GitHub repository. In the README file, include instructions on how to run the script: python phishing_scanner.py Users can then enter a URL when prompted to scan it for phishing risks.

Disclaimer:

While this program offers a basic layer of protection, it's important to note that it may not catch all phishing attempts. Always exercise caution when clicking on links, especially from unknown senders or sources.
